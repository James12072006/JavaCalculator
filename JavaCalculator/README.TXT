How to run :

 How to Run Your Java Program in Any IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, etc.)

 Step 1: Have Java Installed

* Make sure you have the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your computer.
* To check, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

* If not installed, download from [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/).

---

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project in Any IDE

#### For Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse.
2. Click **File > New > Java Project**, name it (e.g., `JavaCalculator`).
3. Right-click the `src` folder > **Import > General > File System**.
4. Select your downloaded folder with `CalculatorApp.java`.
5. Click **Finish**.
6. The Java file should appear inside `src`.
7. Right-click the file > **Run As > Java Application**.

---

#### For IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click **New Project > Java > Next > Next > Finish**.
3. Copy your `CalculatorApp.java` file into the `src` folder of the new project.
4. IntelliJ will automatically compile.
5. Right-click on the file > **Run 'CalculatorApp.main()'**.

---

#### For Visual Studio Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Install the **Java Extension Pack** if you haven‚Äôt already.
3. Open the folder where your `.java` file is.
4. Open `CalculatorApp.java`.
5. You should see a **Run** button above the `main` method.
6. Click **Run** to compile and execute.

---

### Step 3: Running From the Command Line (No IDE)

If you want to run your Java program without any IDE, use this method:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `CalculatorApp.java` is stored.
3. Compile the program:

```bash
javac CalculatorApp.java
```

4. Run the compiled class:

```bash
java CalculatorApp
```

If your class is inside a package, you'll need to run it with the full package path.

## ‚úÖ Steps to Run the Calculator on Your Computer (Using BlueJ)

Since you've been using **BlueJ**, here's how to do it there:

---

### üîπ Step 1: Download the Code from GitHub

If you uploaded just the `.java` file:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **‚ÄúCode‚Äù** button (green).
3. Click **‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù**.
4. Extract the ZIP file.
5. You‚Äôll see your `CalculatorApp.java` file inside.

---

### üîπ Step 2: Open in BlueJ

1. Open BlueJ.
2. Click **‚ÄúProject > New Project‚Äù** ‚Üí name it (e.g., `JavaCalculator`).
3. Click **‚ÄúProject > Add Class From File‚Ä¶‚Äù**
4. Select the downloaded `CalculatorApp.java` file.
5. The class box should appear in BlueJ.

---

### üîπ Step 3: Compile and Run

1. **Double-click** the class to open the code.
2. Click **‚ÄúCompile‚Äù** (top-left).
3. Right-click the class box in the main BlueJ window.
4. Select **`void main(String[] args)`** and click **OK**.

‚úÖ **Your calculator GUI should now pop up!**


 
## Summary

* Your `.java` file can run in **any IDE** that supports Java.
* Import or add the file to the project.
* Compile and run it through the IDE interface or from the command line.
* BlueJ is just one option; Eclipse, IntelliJ, and VS Code are more powerful, industry-standard IDEs.
